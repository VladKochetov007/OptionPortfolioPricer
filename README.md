# OptionPortfolioPricer
Pricer for weighted sum of European vanilla options

## Overview
A web application for pricing and analyzing portfolios of European vanilla options. The tool allows users to:

- Construct option portfolios by combining calls and puts with different strikes and quantities
- Visualize the total portfolio payoff at expiration
- Explore the price surface across different spot prices and times to maturity
- Adjust market parameters like spot price, interest rate, and volatility

## Performance
The application leverages PyTorch's GPU acceleration capabilities to perform parallel computations:
- Vectorized Black-Scholes calculations across the entire price-time surface
- Automatic GPU utilization when available for maximum performance
- Efficient tensor operations for large option portfolios
- Real-time surface updates even with high-resolution grids (up to 1000x1000 points)

## Usage
The application provides an intuitive interface where you can:
1. Set market parameters in the sidebar
- Spot price with step of 1.0
- Risk-free rate in percent
